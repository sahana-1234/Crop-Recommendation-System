# Crop-Recommendation-System
It is a Machine Learning based Project
An AI-powered machine learning application that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and weather parameters.


This project uses a *Random Forest Classifier* to recommend crops by analyzing:
- Nitrogen (N) content in soil
- Phosphorus (P) content in soil
- Potassium (K) content in soil
- Temperature (Â°C)
- Humidity (%)
- pH level of soil
- Rainfall (mm)

Built using:
- Python
- Flask (for the web interface)
- Scikit-learn (for ML model)
- Pandas & NumPy (for data handling)

## ðŸš€ Features
- Simple and user-friendly web interface
- Fast and accurate crop predictions
- Easy to deploy locally or on the cloud
- Trained on agricultural dataset for multiple crop types
